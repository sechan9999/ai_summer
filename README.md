# AI Summer
> Summary repository for AI Summer 2023. Introduction to generative AI, with practical applications to inferencing and training

Presented by Vanderbilt Data Science Institute data scientists:
* Dr. Jesse Spencer-Smith, Chief Data Scientist
* Dr. Charreau Bell, Senior Data Scientist
* Myranda Shirk, Senior Data Scientist
* Umang Chaudhry, Data Scientist
* Dr. Abigail Petulante, DSI Postdoctoral Fellow

## Overview
The objective of these workshops is to develop foundational skills in understanding, inferencing and training generative AI models and other transformer models.  

### Course Coverage

### Getting the Most out of this Course
To get the most out of this crash course in Python:
* Open Colab (workbook) notebooks and actively write code along with the instructor
* Actively participate in discussion
* Actively participate in breakout rooms
* Perform homework assignments before coming to class the next day
* Relax your mind and ask questions
* Let us know how you are doing using Fastcups at https://cups.fast.ai/vanderbilt-ai-summer!

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

- Sign up for a Google Collaboratory account. The free account should be sufficient, but you will get more compute (and longer running times) if you sign up for Colab Pro at ~$5/month.
- Sign up for a Hugginface.co account. Again, the free account should be sufficient.
- Suggested: Preview the book Natural Language Processing with Transformers by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra and Thomas Wolf. If you are affiliated with Vanderbilt University, you can access this pre-print book (and any book by O’Reilly) free by logging into O'Reilly Media using your Vanderbilt email address. Vanderbilt licenses all content from O’Reilly. The book covers Transformers for purposes beyond text. 
- Think about any data you might want to bring to the workshop. Also begin thinking about any projects you might want to accomplish during our month. We’ll have office hours for you to work with us to get your first project off the ground!

## Breakout Rooms

### How to Breakout

Remember we are all learning and exploring
- Please share your video upon entering the room and unmute
- Share your screens--someone volunteer to share their screen upon entering, and everyone be ready to share your screen to show what you’ve found
- Make notes of what you’ve discussed in the Response Reports below
- Everyone be ready to report out (random)
- Make some friends
- Breakout Rooms Worksheets

### Report Documents
Google Docs has a limit of 100 people viewing/editing a document at one time. 

- If your room number is 1 through 10, use Breakout Room Report 1-10.
- If your room number is 11 through 20, use Breakout Room Report 11-20.
- If your room number is 21 through 30, use Breakout Room Report 21-30.
- If your room number is 31 through 40, use Breakout Room Report 31-40.
- If your room number is 41 through 50, use Breakout Room Report 41-50.

### Special Breakout Room Groups

Please be sure your display name is set in Zoom. If you are in one of the following special groups, please pre-pend your name with one of the following qualifiers. For example, I might be
- DSSG-Jesse Spencer-Smith
- Data Science for Social Good: DSSG
- Center for AI in Protein Dynamics: Protein
- If you are in a lab and would like your own breakout room: Labname (keep it short, please!)
- If you are faculty and would like to be in a breakout room with other faculty: Faculty

## Using Fastcups
