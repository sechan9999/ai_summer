## Breakout Rooms

### How to Breakout

Remember we are all learning and exploring
- Please share your video upon entering the room and unmute
- Share your screens--someone volunteer to share their screen upon entering, and everyone be ready to share your screen to show what you’ve found
- Make notes of what you’ve discussed in the Response Reports below
- Everyone be ready to report out (random)
- Make some friends
- Breakout Rooms Worksheets

### Report Documents
Google Docs has a limit of 100 people viewing/editing a document at one time. 

- If your room number is 1 through 10, use [Breakout Room Report 1-10](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wzyXgBRjjCqYriZwDBLfDhLpjYZWlK-FBVrhn4KgWo/edit?usp=sharing)
- If your room number is 11 through 20, use Breakout Room Report 11-20.
- If your room number is 21 through 30, use Breakout Room Report 21-30.
- If your room number is 31 through 40, use Breakout Room Report 31-40.
- If your room number is 41 through 50, use Breakout Room Report 41-50.

### Special Breakout Room Groups

Please be sure your display name is set in Zoom. If you are in one of the following special groups, please pre-pend your name with one of the following qualifiers. 
- Data Science for Social Good: DSSG
- Center for AI in Protein Dynamics: Protein
- If you are in a lab and would like your own breakout room: Labname (keep it short, please!)
- If you are faculty and would like to be in a breakout room with other faculty: Faculty

For example, I might be *DSSG-Jesse Spencer-Smith*
